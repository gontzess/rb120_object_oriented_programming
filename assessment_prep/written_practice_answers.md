#### OOP Book & Lessons

**What is OOP? List all the benefits of OOP?**
OOP stands for Object Oriented Programming. This paradigm of programming arose as software systems became more complex. OOP allows us to section off/contain code with similar functionality into smaller parts. This allows for easier maintenance, re usability, and readability. It also allows for easier program concepting using nouns (objects) and verbs (methods).
- reduce dependencies
- allow thinking on a new levels of abstraction
- better data protection only exposing intended functionality
- flexibility to reuse pre-written code
- ability to organize behaviors and attributes through more superclasses and specialized subclasses

**What is encapsulation? How is this achieved in Ruby?**
Encapsulation is hiding pieces of functionality from the larger program or code ecosystem. We can define specific, intentional ways to leverage the hidden functionality through a public interface. This serves as a form of data protection to avoid any unintentional data manipulation or changes.
Ruby achieves this through creating objects and exposing specific interfaces (methods) to interact with those objects.

**What is polymorphism? What are the different ways to apply polymorphism in Ruby?**
Polymorphism is the ability for different data types (ie objects) to leverage a common interface. Inheritance, mixins, and duck typing are all variations of polymorphism in Ruby.
