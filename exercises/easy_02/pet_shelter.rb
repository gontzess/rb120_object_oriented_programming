# ________
# FURTHER EXPLORATION: Suppose the shelter has a number of not-yet-adopted pets, and wants to manage them through this same system. Thus, you should be able to add the following output to the example output shown above:
# The Animal Shelter has the following unadopted pets:
# a dog named Asta
# a dog named Laddie
# a cat named Fluffy
# a cat named Kat
# a cat named Ben
# a parakeet named Chatterbox
# a parakeet named Bluebell
#    ...
#
# P Hanson has 3 adopted pets.
# B Holmes has 4 adopted pets.
# The Animal shelter has 7 unadopted pets.
