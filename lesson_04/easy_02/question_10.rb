# What are the benefits of using Object Oriented Programming in Ruby? Think of as many as you can.

# 1. OOP allows for better organization and sectioning off of functionality within programs. This makes for easier program readibility and maintenance.
# 2. OOP allows for customizing objects, so that tailored attributes and behaviors can be defined and exposed for use. This also allows for hiding attributes and behaviors that are unneccesary for end users, ensuring a clean interface.
# 3. OOP allows programmers to think more abstractly about their programs. In a similiar vein, they can think about their programs as nouns (objects) that have tailored attributes and behaviors.
# 4. OOP allows for less duplication of code/functionality and for easier incorporation of pre-written code. Less "re-inventing the wheel" all around.
